# Uranium-Image-Cleanup
A program that uses the OpenCV computer vision library to remove unwanted labels from specific images of uranium.
I made this in collaboration with a team for a class in college as a senior. I programmed all the image processing code for this project.

Refer to the user manual we created to see how it works.
It has been packaged as an executable that can be downloaded via this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PQ2ROzLB5HEbHGVaiH7tyDTsmo7SphgO/view?usp=sharing

It also has been packaged and is downloadable via pip install. PyPi link: https://pypi.org/project/uranium-image-cleanup
